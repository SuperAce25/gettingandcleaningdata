##This is how I find the result to the first question of the Week 2 from the course Getting and Cleaning Data of Coursera
##First you have to open R instead of RStudio
##You have to install 3 packages:
install.packages("jsonlite")

install.packages("httpuv")

install.packages("httr")

##And then load the packages:

library(jsonlite)

library(httpuv)

library(httr)

## Now you have to create an API to access data from GITHUB:
## You open this URL: https://github.com/settings/developers
## Name the App as you want and fill the data as follow:
## In Homepage URL: http://github.com ## Because the data is github!
## Authorization callback URL: http://localhost:1410
## Push 'Accept' and create a new client
## Copy the client secret and go back to R

## Execute the following statements:

oauth_endpoints("github")
myapp <- oauth_app("github",
  key = "56b637a5baffac62cad9",
  secret = "8e107541ae1791259e9987d544ca568633da2ebf"
)
##With your corresponding key and secret

github_token <- oauth2.0_token(oauth_endpoints("github"), myapp)
gtoken <- config(token = github_token)
req <- GET("CHOSEN_URL", gtoken) ##Here you replace with the URL they want you to access
## 'req' has the information in JSON format, so you have to extract it by using the function 'content()'
json1 <- content(req)
## but to transform it to dataframe (I think) you have o use the following command:
dataframe  <- jsonlite::fromJSON(toJSON(json1))
## In the 'dataframe' variable is the data that you are looking for, now you can look for the information required.
